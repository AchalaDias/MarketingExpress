If you are just starting out or trying to move your business to the next level, it’s important that you know how to describe your business in a few short sentences. It will come in handy with your marketing efforts and when speaking to employees, new customers or potential investors. It is very important to be able to tell your story quickly and clearly.<br/><br/>

Don’t worry if you are not sure how to tell your story yet. That is what this section is for; to teach you how to better tell the story of your business.
<br/><br/>
This is what I used to tell people who asked me what I do; “I own a marketing firm.” That may have been okay for them, but it wasn’t good enough for me or for attracting potential clients.
<br/><br/>
Over time and with some practice I got a little better at describing what my firm does. To do that, I came up with a way to best describe what a company does. After I applied the techniques that I am going to share with you in this guide, my business description went from, “I own a marketing firm” to: “Walsh/wexford is a Business Marketing firm helping small business owners get to the next level.”
<br/><br/>
The new description sounds a little better but what it really does it tell a bigger story. It just doesn’t say that I own a marketing firm; it says who I help and what I help them do. I can use my new description at a business meeting, with potential customers or the support team I work with. You can do the same for your business. If you put the time and work into how best to tell your story, you be able to communicate much better with your marketing team, your employees and investors.
